Here's a Python script that generates a patch for the given C code vulnerability:

```python
import subprocess

# Create a full modified C code string which addresses the vulnerability
modified_code = """
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

char items[3][10];

void func_a(){
    char* buff;
    int i = 0;
    do{
        printf("input item:");
        buff = &items[i][0];
        i++;
        fgets(buff, 40, stdin);
        buff[strcspn(buff, "\n")] = 0;
    }while(strlen(buff)!=0);
    i--;
}

void func_b(){
    char *buff;
    int j;
    printf("done adding items\n");
    printf("display item #:");
    scanf("%d", &j);
    
    // Validate the index j
    if (j >= 0 && j < 3) {
        buff = &items[j][0];
        printf("item %d: %s\n", j, buff);
    } else {
        printf("Invalid item number. Please enter a value between 0 and 2.\n");
    }
}

#ifndef ___TEST___
int main()
{

    func_a();

    func_b();


    return 0;
}
#endif
"""

# Write this modified code into a new file 'modified_mock_vp.c'
with open('modified_mock_vp.c', 'w') as f:
    f.write(modified_code)

# Open and read original code from file path: "mock-cp/src/samples/mock_vp.c"
try:
    with open("mock-cp/src/samples/mock_vp.c", 'r') as f:
        original_code = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Original code not found.")
else:
    # Generate a diff file which is a patch between the original and modified code
    subprocess.run(['diff', '-u', 'mock-cp/src/samples/mock_vp.c', 'modified_mock_vp.c'], stdout=open('x.diff', 'w'))
```

This script first creates a full modified C code string that addresses the vulnerability. It then writes this modified code into a new file named `modified_mock_vp.c`. 

Next, it opens and reads the original code from the specified file path. If the original code is found, it generates a diff file which is a patch between the original and modified code using the `diff` command.

The generated patch is saved in a file named `x.diff`.

Note that this script assumes that you have the `diff` command available on your system. Also, make sure to replace `"mock-cp/src/samples/mock_vp.c"` with the actual path to the original C code file if it's different.
