Here's a Python script that creates a patch for the given C code vulnerability:

```python
import subprocess

# Read original code from file path: "mock-cp/src/samples/mock_vp.c"
with open("mock-cp/src/samples/mock_vp.c", 'r') as f:
    original_code = f.read()

# Create a full modified C code string which fixes the vulnerability
modified_code = """
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

char items[3][10];

void func_a(){
    char buff[40];
    int i = 0;
    do{
        printf("input item:");
        fgets(buff, 40, stdin);
        buff[strcspn(buff, "\n")] = 0;
        if (strlen(buff) != 0 && strlen(buff) <= 10) {
            strcpy(&items[i][0], buff);
            i++;
        }
    }while(strlen(buff)!=0);
}

void func_b(){
    char *buff;
    printf("done adding items\n");
    int j;
    printf("display item #:");
    scanf("%d", &j);
    if (j >= 0 && j < 3) {
        buff = &items[j][0];
        printf("item %d: %s\n", j, buff);
    }
}

#ifndef ___TEST___
int main()
{

    func_a();

    func_b();


    return 0;
}
#endif
"""

# Write the modified code into a new file 'modified_mock_vp.c'
with open('modified_mock_vp.c', 'w') as f:
    f.write(modified_code)

# Generate a diff file which is a patch between the original and modified code
subprocess.run(['diff', '-uN', "mock-cp/src/samples/mock_vp.c", "modified_mock_vp.c"], stdout=open("x.diff", "w"))
```

This script first reads the original C code from the specified file path. Then, it creates a modified version of the code that fixes the buffer overflow vulnerability by limiting the input length and checking for valid indices in `func_b()`. The modified code is written to a new file named 'modified_mock_vp.c'.

Finally, the script uses the `diff` command with the `-uN` option to generate a patch between the original and modified code. This patch is saved in a file named 'x.diff'.
